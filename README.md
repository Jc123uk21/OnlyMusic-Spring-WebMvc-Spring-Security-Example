This project is to provide an example of how a web application can be implemented using the Spring WebMvc design pattern in an 
annoation based fashion, the implementation makes use of some of the core model, view and controller concepts and methods. Additional layers 
to handle data transfers and data access have also been incorperated into the system to aid the transportation of data between the client 
and a database, a basic form of Spring security is also incorperated into the project to ensure that the project has at the very least 
a basic form of authentication and authorization security. 

The theme for the project is set around a media web application which allows it's users to download and store music tracks held within the 
application's database on their device, the application is also accessed by an administrational team to conduct administrational duties over the application.
Both sets of users share a single login facility where access to the various system resources are determined by the individual user's access role setout
within the security configuration of the application.
